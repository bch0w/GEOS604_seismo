This class repository contains a Conda environment install file `environment.yml` that is necessary to complete all homeworks. 

All homework assignments are located in `homeworks/` as Markdown files. These should be rendered automatically when viewed in GitHub. I will also strive to convert Markdown files to PDFs and share those for those who may not have internet access, but please note that the markdown files will always be the most up-to-date source.

Students should fork this repository to their own GitHub account and complete and push Jupyter notebook homeworks in the `notebooks/` directory. See instructions inside HW1 Problem 0 to set up your working environment.
